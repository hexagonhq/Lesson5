					<h2 class="content-heading">What you need to know about Tomorrowland</h2>
					<p class="content-text mrgnb">
							For 13 years in a row, the festival takes place 3 days from July 21 to July 23 in the Belgian city of Boom, and, in my opinion, the name of the place very much fits the description of what is happening there. But the most unique thing about this festival is that it has become so large-scale and famous that it was almost impossible to get to it, as hundreds of thousands of tickets fly away in a matter of seconds immediately after the start of sales. By the way, I have been following the festival since 2013, and only in 2017 I managed to get on it, all my previous attempts to snatch a ticket were in vain!
					</p>
					<p class="content-text">
							The tradition of the festival is to take the flag of your country and carry it on yourself. Thus, you can easily recognize your people in a crowd of many thousands plus communicate with representatives of countries that interest you. On Tomorowland, all the people around you are your friends! As far as I even know, there has not been a single conflict between people since the founding of the festival, and even the head of the <ins>United Nations</ins> left a message to the visitors of Tomorrowland: "Let's work together to give a decent future to all the inhabitants of the planet." What is interesting there vysepit? It depends on who is looking for what, but for me the most important thing was to communicate with people.

					<h2 class="content-heading">Trip to Tomorrowland Russia</h2>
					<p class="content-text mrgnb">
							I learned about the festival thanks to their best marketing ploy! Every year, the organizers shoot an unrealistically beautiful video about how each festival goes, each of them takes an average of 15-20 minutes, and it displays every detail of the festival and the brightest moments. I just climbed on youtube and suddenly came across a video of 2013 with this festival and immediately decided that I should get there.
					</p>
					<p class="content-text mrgnb">
							But my dream came true only in 2017. It turns out that an official representative of Tomorrowland appeared in Russia, who provided not only a guaranteed ticket, but also the coolest tour with a great company. This representative is named Alexander Nord, and he owns the travel agency Dream travel studio, which travels to various major music events around the world. I immediately contacted the company and bought a tour, which included a ticket, transfer and accommodation, and the coolest thing for the money was much cheaper than if I bought a ticket and booked a hotel or camping myself. I only needed to get to Gdansk by myself.
